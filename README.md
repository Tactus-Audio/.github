# Tactus Audio

*Open Source Audio DSP for Microcontrollers and FPGAs*

## About

Tactus Audio is dedicated to advancing practical audio signal processing through open source projects, tutorials, and educational resources. Our focus lies in real-world implementations of synthesizers, audio effects, and DSP algorithms for embedded systems.

## Mission

As the digital audio landscape continues to evolve, there's a growing need for practical, musically-relevant implementations that bridge the gap between theory and application. Tactus Audio provides:

- **Practical audio DSP projects** using widely available, affordable microcontrollers
- **Real-world implementations** that prioritize working code over mathematical theory
- **Broadly applicable techniques** - while audio-focused, the methods translate to many embedded applications
- **Accessible hardware platforms** - no expensive development boards or specialized equipment required
- **Educational resources** for Makers, hobbyists, and embedded engineers at all skill levels

## Focus Areas

### Practical Audio DSP on Affordable Hardware
- STM32F4, STM32F7, and STM32H7 implementations using readily available development boards
- Virtual analog synthesizer designs
- Real-time audio effects processing
- Custom DAE (Digital Audio Engine) frameworks

### Broadly Applicable Embedded Techniques
While audio-focused, these projects demonstrate techniques valuable across many domains:
- Real-time signal processing patterns
- Efficient interrupt handling and DMA usage  
- Memory optimization strategies
- Fixed-point arithmetic and lookup table techniques
- Performance profiling and optimization methods

### FPGA Audio Processing
- High-performance parallel audio algorithms
- Low-latency processing architectures
- Custom audio processing pipelines

### Educational Content for Makers and Engineers
Each project is accompanied by detailed tutorials available at [www.tactusaudio.com](https://www.tactusaudio.com), covering:
- Step-by-step implementation guides using common, affordable hardware
- Performance optimization techniques applicable to many embedded projects
- Practical debugging and testing approaches
- Real-world considerations over theoretical completeness

## Philosophy

> "If you can't hear it make a difference, remove it."

Our approach prioritizes:
- **Practical implementation** over theoretical completeness
- **Affordable, accessible hardware** - using development boards anyone can purchase
- **Musical relevance** over mathematical perfection  
- **Broadly applicable techniques** - audio provides the examples, but the methods apply widely
- **Clear, maintainable code** that Makers and engineers can learn from and adapt
- **Audible results** as the ultimate measure of success

## About the Maintainer

Drawing from a 40+ year career in embedded systems and a background as a classically trained musician who worked in professional studios during the synthesizer revolution of the 1980s and 1990s, these projects represent a synthesis of deep technical knowledge and musical understanding.

The combination of extensive microcontroller experience and hands-on familiarity with vintage synthesizers and effects provides a unique perspective on implementing audio DSP that serves real musical needs.

## Getting Started

Browse our repositories to find projects that match your interests and skill level. All projects are designed around commonly available, affordable development boards - no expensive or hard-to-find hardware required.

Each repository includes:
- Complete, buildable source code
- Bill of materials using readily available components
- Hardware setup instructions for common development boards
- Links to corresponding tutorial articles
- Audio samples and demonstrations where applicable
