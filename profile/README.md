# Tactus Audio

**Open Source Audio DSP for Makers, Hackers, and Curious Engineers**

## What’s This All About?

Tactus Audio is a hobby project and learning resource focused on practical, real-time audio DSP—especially using microcontrollers and FPGAs. It’s for makers, musicians, tinkerers, and embedded nerds who like to build things that make noise.

You'll find working code, real-time audio projects, and tutorials aimed at people who'd rather hear results than do the math.

## Why?

Because audio DSP doesn’t have to be expensive, theoretical, or locked away in academic papers. This is hands-on, accessible, and open source.

Tactus Audio exists to:

* Share practical, working DSP code that runs on affordable dev boards
* Explore sound synthesis, effects, and DSP techniques that anyone can use
* Document tips and tricks that apply to all kinds of embedded systems—not just audio
* Help fellow makers understand and enjoy audio DSP without needing a PhD

## What You'll Find Here

### Microcontroller-Based Audio DSP

* Real-time effects and synths on STM32F4/F7/H7 and ESP32 boards
* Virtual analog designs, delay lines, filters, oscillators, etc.
* A custom lightweight DSP framework
* Using widely available components.

### Embedded Techniques That Go Beyond Audio

* Real-time code patterns for MCUs
* Interrupts, DMA, circular buffers, and fixed-point math
* Code that works hard to run fast, not just look clever

### FPGA Audio Experiments

* Parallel DSP pipelines
* Ultra-low-latency designs
* Just enough HDL to make cool sounds

### Maker-Friendly Tutorials

All projects are paired with blog posts or guides at [tactusaudio.com](https://www.tactusaudio.com), including:

* Step-by-step build instructions
* Explanations of how and why things work
* Debugging tips and gotchas
* Sound clips and scope captures when possible

## A Quick Philosophy Break

> "If you can’t hear it make a difference, remove it."

This whole project runs on:

* Practical over perfect
* Real-time over real-complicated
* Music-first, math-second
* Code that’s hackable, not impenetrable

## Who’s Behind This?

I'm a lifelong embedded engineer with 40+ years in the industry and a side passion for audio. I grew up during the analog synth boom, worked in studios in the '80s and '90s, and now enjoy building DSP toys in my spare time.

This isn’t my day job—it’s my hobby. And if you like to solder, scope, or synthesize, maybe it's yours too.

## Got Ideas?

Open a pull request, file an issue, or just reach out. This is a hobby, not a product—experiments, suggestions, and side quests are welcome.

## License

All projects are open source and free to use, tweak, and share.
